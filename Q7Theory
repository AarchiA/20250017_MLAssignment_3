Q7

Transfer learning :
It is a way of using a already trained model on a related task.
VGG-16 with 16 layers achieved great results on ImageNet classification challenge
Model consist of two parts, one is the VGG blocks for extraction part and classifier part is made of fully connected layers and output layer.

VGG1 :
One block VGG consists of single convolutional layer with 32 filters followed by a max pooling layer.
Each layer uses ReLU activation function. We can also use more blocks. 


VGG1 with data augmentation :
Data augmentation is used to synthetically expand the train dataset size by making some changes in the dataset's image.
It act as a regularization technique and helps in learning features. These changes in input help in learning important features.
