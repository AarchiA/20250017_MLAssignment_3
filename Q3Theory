Digit 8 and Digit 0 are the most confused.
Digit 7 is the easiest to predict as it is not getting confused.

Interpretation: 
We can see 10 digits through 10 different classes, each digit is represented by a different shade. Different classes and their instances are almost clearly grouped in clusters and are distinct.
With the exception for the class that is confused the most, its instances are sparsely distributed over the plane and overlap other classes.
We can see classe that are distinct and do not get confused often at the extremes.
The contiguous classes correspond to similar digits, suggesting they are difficult to separate.
Clusters that are close are expected to have similar graphical representation. Whereas far away clusters are not confused and are relatively easier to distinguish.
