Q4. Time and space complexity for Logistic regression learning and prediction

Answer: Time complexity for learning:
O(nd)
Where n is number of data points
d is the size of weight vector 
Performing the summation operation takes  O(d)  and then iterating over all the n data points makes the time complexity to O(nd)

Time complexity for prediction:
O(d)
Where d is the size of weight vector, once the weights and bias are learnt we just classify the data points accordingly.

Space complexity for learning:
O(nd+n+d)
Here we have two matrices x and y of dimensions (n x d) and (n x 1) respectively, weights vector of size d and bias is order O(1)

Space complexity for prediction:
O(d)
Once learning is done we just keep the weights and classify the points so order is size of weights matrix.
